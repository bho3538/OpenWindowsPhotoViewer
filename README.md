# OpenWindowsPhotoViewer
Open Windows default photo app from command line (with previous / next button)

# How to use
Just pass file path at arguments\
ex) OpenImageViewer.exe "c:\folder\folder 2\image.png"

# Why need this program
If you open image using command line like this (start c:\folder\folder 2\image.png)\
Image will be open, but photo app does not have 'previous / next image' button.
